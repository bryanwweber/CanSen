==================================
Welcome to CanSen's documentation!
==================================

`CanSen`_ is a Python script that provides a SENKIN-like wrapper around
the open-source `Cantera`_ package. The motivation for this project
is to ease the transition from SENKIN to using Cantera. Many
researchers have knowledge of how to build SENKIN input files, and
many may have SENKIN input files available that they use. CanSen
enables the use of SENKIN-formatted input files with Cantera.

CanSen can be used with any version of Python >= 2.6.

CanSen is hosted at `GitHub <CanSen_>`_, if you are interested in the
source code and development. Please report any bugs there.
